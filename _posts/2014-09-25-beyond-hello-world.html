<p>Anytime anyone starts learning a Programming langauge they start out with the traditional "Hello-World" program.</p>
<p>This is great for a beginner i.e for someone who's done little to no programming before because it gives some form of output immediately without putting in much effort <strong>^1</strong> .</p>
<p>This is good because it provides instant gratification in some sense and acts as bait to get a newcomer hooked.</p>
<p>There's amazement -- "I just made the computer talk! So cool!"</p>
<p>It's all very exciting... for a beginner.</p>
<p>When a person who's been programming for a while tries to pick up a new language, the "Hello World" route isn't necessarily the best way to get started.</p>
<p>It serves no real purpose to start out outputting text to screen because it's no longer amazing and isn't a great indicator of the languages real capabilities, strengths or flaws.<br />
The only thing that is immediately clear is how verbose the language is likely to be.</p>
<p>Here are "Hello World" Programs in a couple of common languages:</p>

{% highlight bash %}
# Bash
echo Hello World
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight python %}
# Python
print 'Hello World'
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight c %}
// C
#include<stdio.h>
int main(){
    printf("Hello World\n");
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight scheme %}
;; Scheme/Racket
(print "Hello World")
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight java %}
/* Java */
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World");
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight rust %}
// Rust
fn main() {
println!("Hello World");
}
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
// Javascript
console.log("Hello World");
{% endhighlight %}

<p>Looking at these 7 odd snippets of code all one can really conclude is that Bash, JavaScript, Python and Scheme are a little less tedious to write than the rest.</p>
<p>In real life scenarios all 7 of these languages are used for vastly different things and have vastly different advantages, the tedium of writing them is typically the last concern.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is sometimes a "Hello World" isn't enough.<br />
All the smart people I've talked to always suggest picking up a small "project" when learning a language because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It keeps you interested.</li>
<li>Projects typically force you to explore different parts of the language.</li>
<li>You get some real world experience with the language.</li><br />
</ul><br />
I've tried taking this advice and it works out fairly well.<br />
Pick a language, run through it's basics fairly quickly (a day or so) and then get hacking on an easy-ish project, typically it helps if you don't have to learn a&nbsp;<strong>lot</strong> of <em>other</em> concepts while you're building your project so that you can dedicate most of your time to learning the language itself.</p>
<p>Recently I've been trying to pick up Racket as a language in my spare time (It's also used in a course I'm taking, but a very limited subset).</p>
<p>Now there's an amazing <strong>#racket</strong> community on freenode and they use <a href="http://pasterack.org" target="_blank">Pasterack </a>to share code amongst themselves.<br />
The clever thing about this pastebin is that it's an evaulating pastebin. It takes your code, runs it in a sandbox and shows the evaluated output as well as the code itself.</p>
<p>Pretty neat.</p>
<p>I wanted to start using this pastebin as well, but having gotten used to <strong>mozpaste</strong>, <strong>fpaste</strong> and <strong>pastebinit</strong>, I no longer have the patience to actually copy text from my terminal, paste it into a webpage, submit the form and the copy and paste the url to the person I'm taking in IRC.</p>
<p>It's a hassle.</p>
<p>And so I decided that I would write a pastebin script for <a href="http://pasterack.org" target="_blank">Pasterack</a>.</p>
<p>I've written pastebin scripts before and it's not a really complicated task.<br />
The reason writing a pastebin script is so useful is because despite its simplicity, it typically covers a very wide subset of language's capabilities. You'll be using the language's OS interfacing capabilities.</p>
<p>Filesystem I/O, string Parsing, HTTP/Network libraries, command line parsing, Error handling and bit of regex thrown in here and there for good measure.</p>
<p>I'm not claiming that a pastebin script is the miracle program that will tell you everything about the language, it's not.</p>
<p>It will on the other hand definitely give you a better idea of how much it excels at doing various things. Questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li><em> "Is the language great for prototyping?"</em></li>
<li><em> "Is it easy to write readable code?"</em></li>
<li><em>&nbsp;"Does it come with a great builtin set of tools?"</em></li>
<li><em>&nbsp;"Is it fast?"</em></li>
<li><em> "Is it a nightmare to debug?"</em></li><br />
</ul><br />
and many others can be answered with an <em>easy-ish</em> project like this.</p>
<p>I did end up writing that pastebin script for <a href="http://pasterack.org" target="_blank">Pasterack</a> and it can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/ffledgling/PasteRackIt" target="_blank">PasteRackIt</a>.</p>
<p>It took me about 2 days and lots of blundering through the Racket Docs<strong>^2</strong> before I had anything substantial, but as a result of it all I've seen a lot more of the language than I would have if I were limited to using it in my course.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this article is that when learning something it's always a great idea to go beyond the usual <em>"Hello World"</em> equivalent. Find your own "<em>Pastebin</em>" and work on it, hack away in the language of your choice and maybe, just maybe there's some skill to be gained that way.</p>

<p><strong>^1</strong> Unless you're writing Java. Tough luck in that case pal.</p>
<p><strong>^2</strong> The <a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/" target="_blank">Racket Docs</a> are amazing btw.</p>

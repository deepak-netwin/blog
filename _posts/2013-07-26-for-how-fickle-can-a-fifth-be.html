<p>"Fie, Fie ffledgling! for having forsaken thy foremost duties again!". Yes Shakespeare I understand.</p>
<p>As is now becoming a frequent occurrence, this update has been overdue and <em>technically</em> should've been out a few days ago, but then again, it has been a fickle fifth week.<br />
Last week was characterized by contradictions and rapid changes. I went from having the fastest internet I've had in a while, to nearly no internet for a while. Days in the past week have seen me both at my productive and counter-productive best.</p>
<p>Productive and counter-productive at what you ask? Why my Summer of Code Project ofcourse!<br />
<strong><a href="https://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozdevice.html">Mozdevice</a></strong> has been an interesting module to work on, but I've manged to finish writing all the unit tests I could for it at the moment.</p>
<p>if you&nbsp;<em>really</em> want to take a look at the gory details, there's always a bug number to help you out, and this time it's<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=894062">Bug&nbsp;894062</a></strong>&nbsp;to the rescue!</p>
<p>I will now be moving on to<strong><a href="https://mozbase.readthedocs.org/en/latest/mozprofile.html">&nbsp;Mozprofile</a></strong>! As the weeks progress, the modules I work on seem to grow ever so slightly, both in size and complexity, which was what keeps things interesting ;)</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for the next post!</p>

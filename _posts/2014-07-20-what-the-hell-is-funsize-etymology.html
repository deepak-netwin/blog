<p>The origins of the name, the story behind it all, in a familiar annoying Magazine style Q&amp;A.</p>
<p><strong>Is it a new size of clothing?</strong><br />
<em>No.</em></p>
<p><strong>Is it the name of a compact family hatchback? (Car companies do silly names like this don't they?)</strong><br />
It very possibly could've been, but it's not.</p>
<p><strong>Were you on prohibited substances when you came up with that name?</strong><br />
Um ... <em>No?</em></p>
<p>Now, now, my shocked audience, these are all fair questions.<br />
Please take a seat and get comfortable, get popcorn and your choice of refreshing drink because this will be a long tale.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>I began working on a project with the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering#Team">Release Engineering Team</a> in May '14. The project was originally titled 'Senbonzakura' after the 'Zanpaktuo' from 'Bleach'. Upon introducing the name to my team, everyone had a hard time pronouncing and remembering how to spell it right.</p>
<p>Except Nick.<br />
Nick is a boss and seems to have a knack for remembering long and hard-to-pronounce names. Maybe it's from his days remembering all those unintelligible high atomic number elements' names as an Atomic Scientist.</p>
<p>But I digress.<br />
It was decided after much debate and controversy (not really) that the project had to be re-named.</p>
<p>My project deals with something called "Partial MARs", so I figured calling it "Mars Mini" after the namesake chocolatey treats would be clever. Our non-American English speaking team-mates suggested calling it "Mars Funsize" instead because that's what it's known by in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>And so it came to be.</p>
<p>We christened our new-born Partial MAR generation service "Funsize"!<br />
Which kind of fits, because I had a lot of fun working on it.</p>
<p><strong><begin></strong><br />
And <em>you</em> can too!<br />
If you think Python and scalable Web Applications are your kind of thing, you might want to take a look at the <a href="https://gist.github.com/ffledgling/71dc7bef3708546915f2">Contributing to Funsize</a> and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/Contribute">How to contribute to Release Engineering</a> pages and see if Funsize is your idea of fun!<br />

<p>I've been wanting to resume writing for a long long long time now.<br />
A lot has happened since the last time I wrote for this blog and I'm happy to report a lot of it has been good!</p>
<p>The long and the short of it is that I'll be (am) interning with Mozilla's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering#Team" target="_blank">Release Engineering Team</a>.<br />
These are the guys that manage the releases, build infrastructure and release automation. In short these are the guys responsible for making sure Firefox ships out in time. Make no mistake it's no easy task to ship to half a million users, any lingering doubts about the complexity of this task can probably be dispelled by looking at <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/5/5b/Releng_flow_onepage.pdf" target="_blank">this diagram</a>.</p>
<p>The office space we have is amazing (pictures below). Interns have their own desks and area where they can muck around and not anger the wrath of the employees with all the noise we make. On our first day as interns we got a whole lot of Mozilla <em>schwag</em> given to us by Jill and Misty (our friendly neighbourhood recruiting team), this&nbsp;<em>schwag</em> included a very nice Firefox branded laptop bag, a 2014 interns hoodie and Mozilla branded socks and Sun-Glasses. So. Much. Win.<br />
I also got to meet a lot of fun people, including my current mentor Hal Wine and my GSoC-mentor Clint Talbert, both of them are&nbsp;<em>really</em> fun people. It's very exciting and a lot of fun finally meeting face to face with the people you've worked with and have been talking to over the IRC for such a long time.</p>
<p>I'm working on a <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Ffledgling/Senbonzakura" target="_blank">project</a> (code named Senbonzakura) for the team, which basically involves a web service that generates Firefox updates on demand, but, more about that in the next post!</p>
<p>I'm in San Francisco, one of the most beautiful cities in US. If one were to try and imagine the existence of such a thing as perfect weather, San Francisco's would be pretty close. There's the fresh cool breeze coming from off of the sea, there's the warm but not hot (a tad mild at times, but maybe that's just me) California sun beating down on a city by the bay. It gets a little too chilly for me at times, but it's nothing a thin sweater or light jacket can't fix and did I mention the <em>amazing</em> sea breeze?</p>
<p>There's always a lot going on in the city at any given day, but it's the smaller attractions that are the most fun.<br />
There's so much to take in that it can get very overwhelming very quickly at times, but mostly it's fun to watch the picturesque city go about doing whatever it likes. I've seen people playing drums in the middle of the street, I've saw bikers do wheelies, stopies, acrobatics, spins and many many indescribable moves that seemed so flawless that it was almost inhuman. A friend and I ran into musicians jamming with an acoustic guitar and violin on the street and stood there mesmerized for a while before we realized the song had ended.</p>
<p>In the time I've been here I've had a lot of fun and a lot of&nbsp;<em>fun</em> kitchen accidents as well, if you know what I mean<strong>*</strong>.<br />
The US is a strange yet exciting land and despite exposure to a lot of American and Western media and culture, there are somethings you never truly understand until you experience them first hand.</p>
<p>I've been trying to take pictures to summarize my journey, and although I admit I haven't done a good job of clicking pictures religiously, I do still have a few pictures to share, so here goes:</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140510_162550.jpg"><img id="i-433" class="size-full wp-image" src="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140510_162550.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />
This is the view I was greeted with when I first entered my apartment, needless to say, I couldn't say much for a while afterwards.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140514_183902.jpg"><img id="i-437" class="size-full wp-image" src="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140514_183902.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />
This is the view from my office desk. If you tell me you have a better office space, I'll have a hard time believing you.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140515_185133.jpg"><img id="i-440" class="size-full wp-image" src="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140515_185133.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />
This is a picture of me desk. Jill gave us all cute little fox thing. Cute little fox thing keeps me company when me is at work.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/media/pano_20140518_160631.jpg"><img id="i-445" class="size-full wp-image" src="{{site.url}}/media/pano_20140518_160631.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />
Everyone this is Island Princess, the mammoth Cruise Ship anchored at one of the Piers. I had to use Panorama to take picture of this massive lady because she wouldn't fit in a single frame.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140518_165227.jpg"><img id="i-449" class="size-full wp-image" src="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140518_165227.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />
This is what a deck full of sea lions looks like. They're noisy and they're smelly, but there's something about watching them laze around without a care in the world that's fun to watch.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140528_005912.jpg"><img id="i-453" class="size-full wp-image" src="{{site.url}}/media/img_20140528_005912.jpg" alt="Image" /></a><br />
The bay bridge lights up at night and this is what I see from my bedroom window every night as I sleep. (Well it's much better than this actually, my phone camera doesn't do the view any justice)</p>
<p>Now that I've overcome inertia, hopefully you'll see more posts from me soon!<br />
And with that hopeful promise I shall sign off for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>*</strong>&nbsp;I burnt the toast and set the fire alarm off. Yes, this really happened.</p>

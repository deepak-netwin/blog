<p>The sixth week is over and done with, and I've been putting in some time to work on mozprofile.<br />
Mozprofile seemed like a tricky module initially, I've been working on testing the AddonsManager code mostly, and it comes with it's fair share of "Gotcha"s.<br />
It's not&nbsp;<em>difficult</em> code as such, but it took me more readings than the other modules I've worked with, which is not necessarily a bad thing.<br />
As always there's a bug number associated with the work I've been doing, this time it's <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=898265">898265</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Next up is Mozprocess, which is the last module I need to write unit-tests for as per Schedule. After that I'll be going back and trying to write more tests that I might've missed in the past and I'll be attempting some other slightly trickier stuff, including trying to bundle the Android Emulator so that we can test the SUTAgent. Exciting times!</p>
<p>In other news, The mid-term evaluation results are out, and I happy to inform everyone that I passed my mid-term evaluation. <a href="http://youtu.be/3KVEe6UVpYw" target="_blank">Yay!</a></p>

<p>It's the last week of the Google Summer of Code and I've found myself spending more time getting mozprocess tests in shape.<br />
Mozprocess was one of the more challenging modules I've dealt with in terms of complexity, but it has also been the most enjoyable.</p>
<p>Cross-platform issues are always a joy, and mozprocess lived upto expectations marvelously ;) .<br />
I came across WindowsError exceptions flying through the stack, like chickens flying the coop. Thankfully the WindowsErrors went away (mostly) and the *nix systems were pretty co-operative this time around.</p>
<p>I now have a respectable patch up, approved and r+'d , with a successful try-run.<br />
So Tyche and Fortuna willing, the patch should land pretty soon.</p>
<p>For the entire story please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=778267">Bug 778267</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Patch landed! :D</p>

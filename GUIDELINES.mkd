While writing a post
====================

- Always try to keep *only* one category per post.
- Use the date command to generate the date format for the post
- Use an existing blog post as a template.
- Always prefer to throw media into content.ffleddling.com and link from there.

After
=====

NEVER EVER CHANGE THE POST META DATA AFTER YOU'VE PUT OUT A POST. EVER.
SERIOUSLY. DON'T DO IT.
